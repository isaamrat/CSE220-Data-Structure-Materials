# CSE220 Data Structures Class Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures Class Repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Python and Java.


## Topics

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to different data structures. You can navigate to each data structure's implementation using the links below:

- [Singly Linked List](Singly_linked_list/)
- [Doubly Linked List](Doubly_linked_list/)
- [Dummy Headed Doubly Circular Linked List](Dummy_headed_doubly_circular_liinked_list/)
- [Multi dimensional Array / Two dimensional array](Two_dimensional_array/)
- [Hash Table](Hash_table/)

## Implemented Data Structures

Each data structure folder contains a Python and Java implementation along with relevant documentation and example usage.

## Usage

To use any of these data structures, simply navigate to the respective folder and explore the Python & Java code. Each implementation is designed to be modular and easy to integrate into your projects.

## Plagiarism Concern
Be aware of copying code directly from this repo as all the students have access to this and copying these code may lead to plagirism.
